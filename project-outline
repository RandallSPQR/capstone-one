# The Problem
Nearly all small to mid-sized ecommerce clients use some combination of Facebook and Google as part of their media strategy, and Shopify is the largest ecommerce platform for those types of clients. However, the reporting data is always in conflict between those 3 because of different reporting methodologies. 


# Client and Solution Impact
The primary clients will include most consumer facing ecommerce companies, but can also include B2B businesses. The decision made is the optimal allocation of media dollars among channels, audiences, tactics, timing, frequency, and creative options. Furthermore, the share of media attribution should be apparent, weighting first interaction, contributing, and final interaction differently. 

# Data
Data is daily media spends, reach, frequency, impressions, clicks, engagements, creative type, device, destination/landing page, and purchase conversion value from Facebook/Instagram Business Manager, Google Ad Manager, Criteo, and Shopify. This data is sourced from several of my existing clients.
